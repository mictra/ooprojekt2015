# Calendar++
Calendar++ Object-oriented project

All meeting protocols are in the meetings folder.
RAD and SDD documents are in the documents folder.

NOTE ON RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

We had troubles running the program outside the NetBeans environment. 
Running in the terminal with Maven results in errors. 
We have yet to figure out how to solve the issue.

When we build the project in netbeans, we get no issues.
If there are any issues with running the .jar file from the terminal, please consider running it through NetBeans.
We have not been able to fix this issue in time.

To run on NetBeans:
1. Import calendarplusplus project
2. Clean and Build the project
3. Run the main file

NOTE: Do not run multiple instances of the application (i.e. close the application before rerunning again), since this will result in accessing the database more than once, and end with errors.
